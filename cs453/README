BUILDING AND RUNNING:

 To build: Run 'make' from the top directory.
 To run: Run 'mydash' from the top directory.

PROGRAM DESIGN:
 
 I decided for the first go around, just to not confuse myself
 and to keep things simple I would put everything into one file
 I realize this is no the best idea, but it was easier to test
 for me and less mistakes to make.  I am still using lots of 
 function calls, they are just in one source file.  I tried to 
 do everything that the assignment asked for, but not everything
 went the way I wanted to, so some small details got left out.

DISCUSSION:

 I decided to use git because I could not figure out svn.  Though
 it took me quite some time to figure out git too, but I found a 
 guide for dummies online and used that to help me out.  I did 
 not find this guide, however, until I was most of the way through
 the project, thus the minimal amount of commits.  I did get it 
 working though, so for future projects I should be good to go. 
 I am having at least one issue, which is memory leaks.  I know to
 free anything that is malloced, but I still ahve leasks somewhere.
